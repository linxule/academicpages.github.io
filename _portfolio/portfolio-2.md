I write in Markdown, usually in [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) or [Bear](https://bear.app/). To share my writing with others, I convert the Markdown files into other formats, such as PDF or DOCX.

I use [Marked 2 app (Mac)](https://marked2app.com/) to convert Markdown files and format the output files according to my needs. Long story short, Marked 2 converts a Markdown file into HTML document file, which in turn gets formatted according to a chosen CSS template.

[CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

Marked 2 has a [Style Gallery](https://marked2app.com/styles/#). I have contributed a template ([Chicago Academic](https://marked2app.com/styles/preview#Chicago%20Academic)) based on the Chicago Manual of Style to this gallery. Also, I have created a template for Academic CV.  

You can download these CSS templates here:
