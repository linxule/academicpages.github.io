title: "Academic Writing in Markdown: Formatting with Marked 2 app"
excerpt: "Formatting"

I write in Markdown, usually with [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) or [Bear](https://bear.app/). To share my writing with others, I convert the Markdown files into other formats, such as PDF or DOCX.

I use [Marked 2 app](https://marked2app.com/) (sorry, Mac only) to convert Markdown files and format the output files according to my needs. Long story short, Marked 2 converts a Markdown file into HTML document file, which in turn gets formatted according to a chosen CSS template.

[CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

## Choose Your Style and Format

Marked 2 has a [Style Gallery](https://marked2app.com/styles/#). I have contributed a template ([Chicago Academic](https://marked2app.com/styles/preview#Chicago%20Academic)) based on the Chicago Manual of Style to this gallery.

Also, I have created additional templates for academic writing.

You can download these CSS templates here:
* [Chicago Academic](https://linxule.github.io/files/chicago-academic.css): based on [The Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html)
* [Academic CV](https://linxule.github.io/files/academic-cv.css)
* [Academic Peer Review](https://linxule.github.io/files/academic-review.css): based on [Academy of Management's Reviewer Guidelines](http://aom.org/annualmeeting/reviewerguidelines/), particularly the [Sample Review by Macro Editor](https://aom.org/uploadedFiles/Publications/AMJ/ReviewsbyMacroEditors.pdf).


## Print and Share

As many academic researchers usually read papers in PDF format and write with Microsoft Word. To share my writing, I then convert my writing into PDF or DOCX format.

### Print to PDF

When you are ready, you can export your files in HTML format out of the Marked 2 app. Then you can print the HTML with your browser app.

### Print to DOCX

Similarly, you can open the HTML files with Microsoft Word or other word processors. Then, you can save the HTML file in the DOCX format.

However, **the page margins will likely be changed** to the default setting for new documents. For example, I set the default margins of 1 inch for all new documents created in Microsoft Word.

Cite-while-you-write (CWYW) is another important step in academic writing. I use Zotero, Better BibTex, and Pandoc for CWYW. I hope to cover my methods in the future posts.
