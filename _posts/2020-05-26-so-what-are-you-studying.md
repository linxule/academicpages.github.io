## Decentralization
- This stream of research aims to explore how more decentralized forms of organizing are/ will be different from existing forms of organizing when it comes to venture creation, organizational learning, and innovation.
- As there's a lack of consensus about the definitions of decentralized organizations, my research covers a range of decentralized organizations: Decentralized organizations, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Decentralized Autonomous Corporations/Companies (DACs).
- Some relevant questions:
  - How blockchain technology enables new forms of organizing that are decentralized(e.g. DAOs) ?  
  - What drives the emergence and development of blockchain ecosystems?
  - What are the implications for management research (e.g., boundaries of organizations, unmediated actors, crowdsourcing)?

## Innovation and creativity in culinary arts
- This stream of research aims to explore how the new styles/categories of cuisine emerge and evolve through the networks of elite restaurants and chefs.
- These elite restaurants and chefs are consistently producing innovative and creative dishes and beverages to stay in the competition and earn prestige (i.e., Michelin stars).


## Ideas and theories from other disciplines
Other domains have also shaped how I develop and approach research questions:

- [data as labor in digitized economy](https://radicalxchange.org/blog/posts/2019-1-5-ydij2t/)

- collective action, social movements, governance of commons
