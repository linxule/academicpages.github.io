## Research Tools and Resources for the difficult times of coronavirus

I understand that people face different challenges in research now that we are moving a lot of things online. I have created a Google Sheet as a repository of useful tools and resources that may help with research during the difficult times of coronavirus. Please add anything that you find useful to the Google Sheet. Hope this will help people with their learning and research.

Feel free to contribute to the Google Sheet (link below) !
