At the 2023 UK FinTech Academic Network (UKFAN) Annual Conference, I gave a talk on "**MakerDAO Demystified: Exploring the Decentralized Nature of a Stablecoin Ecosystem**."

> MakerDAO, one of the largest liquidity providers in the crypto industry, operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain, focusing on creating a stablecoin ecosystem. Despite the potential for decentralization and community-driven governance, MakerDAO faces challenges such as the concentration of voting power among a small group of token holders and regulatory hurdles, which require sophisticated strategies to ensure its growth and competitiveness in the evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi).
