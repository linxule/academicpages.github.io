I keep track of **academic conferences, workshops, and calls for papers** in the field of management. I regularly update this list. If you would like to "subscribe" (**sync these events to an external calendar**), please [email to request a link](mailto:xule.lin@imperial.ac.uk).

**Let me know if you would like to contribute to this list!**
