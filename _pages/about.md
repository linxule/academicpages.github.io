I am a [PhD student](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/xule.lin) in the [Department of Management & Entrepreneurship at the Imperial College Business School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/academic-areas/management-entrepreneurship/). I joined Imperial in 2019. Prior to this, I studied at at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Chicago. I also gained valuable professional experience working at Ernst & Young (EY) in Chicago.

# Research Interests

My research explores the intersection of new forms of organizing and decentralized coordination. My thesis specifically focuses on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), where technology is extensively integrated into coordination processes. As an extension of this work, I also investigate traditional bespoke tailoring shops, which have largely resisted modern technological integration. This comparison allows me to examine how social and algorithmic mechanisms shape decentralized coordination across the spectrum of technological adoption.

Empirically, I study how DAO communities leverage technology to develop and evolve decentralized coordination mechanisms without traditional hierarchical structures, while also exploring how traditional craft-based settings maintain effective coordination with minimal technological intervention. By analyzing these divergent cases, I aim to shed light on the current decentralization trends and gain valuable lessons for organizational design and adaptation in the digital age.

Methodologically, my work combines a grounded theory approach with AI-based analysis tools, including BERTopic and large language models (LLMs). This interdisciplinary approach allows for rich, context-specific insights and broader pattern recognition. Overall, my research seeks to advance theory on the dynamics enabling organizational design, particularly in understanding how different combinations of social norms, expertise, and technology influence organizational effectiveness and adaptability.

# Sharing Knowledge and Resources

I have curated various X (formerly Twitter) lists focused on management research, DAOs, and AI research, which provide valuable insights and updates from experts in these fields.
- [Management Research](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1186983495517773825): People, Organizations, Blogs & Journals in Management, Strategy, Org Behavior, and Related Fields
- [Research on DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1176535611269898240): Mgmt focused, technical & non-technical information on DAOs
- [AI Research](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1761815451116413191): AI research with implications for advancing organizational research

Writing in markdown helps me focus on the writing rather than organizing and formatting. Check out my post on "Streamlining Academic Writing and Citation Management: The Case for a Markdown-centric Approach to Academic Writing [(MaCAW)](https://linxule.com/posts/2023/10/macaw/)"

I have also created and adapted a [collection of themes, scripts, templates](https://github.com/linxule/themes) for Zotero, Marked 2, Deckset, and more.
