My personal website
======
After eight years of studying and working in the US, I moved to London in the autumn of 2019. Currently, I am a PhD student in the Department of Management and Entrepreneurship at the Imperial College Business School.

One stream of my research looks at the blockchain/distributed ledger technology and decentralized autonomous organizations(DAOs). Another stream of my research looks at the innovation and creativity in culinary arts. My theoretical approaches stem from organizational theory & learning, entrepreneurial & platform ecosystems, and social networks. To understand these new phenomenons, I also look outside of management research for relevant theories and findings. In particular, I am interested in the topics of deliberative democracy, collective action, stigma, and anonymity.
