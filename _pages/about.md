I am a PhD student in the Department of Management and Entrepreneurship at the Imperial College Business School. I joined Imperial in 2019. Previously, I spent eight years studying and working in South Bend and Chicago. 

## Current research focus

  * Ecosystems, governance, organizational design  
  * DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), crypto, public goods, commons
  * Communities, collective action, social movements  

More on my [research interests](/posts/2020/05/so-what-are-you-studying/) and [current projects](/portfolio/).

## Academic Writing in Markdown
Markdown helps me focus on the writing rather than organizing and formatting. See how to set up your workflow for [academic writing in Markdown](https://linxule.com/portfolio/portfolio-2/).

Software/tools that I am currently using:
1. [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)(best integration with Zotero: in-app look up citation, one click to open associated PDF)
2. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)(similar to Roam Research but offline. Local network graphs!)
3. [Roam-Highligher - Chrome Extension](https://github.com/GitMurf/roam-highlighter#how-to-use-the-highlighter) (great to taking notes on webpages and paste highlights in markdown)


## Resources and tools
A growing database of various learning resources and tools, including research softwares(DEVONthink, Notion, Stata), research methods(qualitative), workshops, and online courses (CARMA).
