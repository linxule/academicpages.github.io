My personal website
======
After eight years of studying and working in the US, I moved to London in the autumn of 2019. Currently, I am a PhD student in the Department of Management and Entrepreneurship at the Imperial College Business School.

My research interests lie in the contexts of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), blockchain/distributed ledger technology/crypto, and culinary arts. Further, I adopt the perspectives of organizational theory & learning, deliberative democracy, and collective action. In the meantime, I am looking to integrate the theories of  entrepreneurial & platform ecosystems and social networks in my research.
