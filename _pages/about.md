I study how humans and machines are reshaping the future of organizations.

Some things about me:
* PhD researcher at [Imperial College Business School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/academic-areas/management-entrepreneurship/) studying organizational evolution
* Previously built skills at University of Notre Dame, University of Chicago, and Ernst & Young
* Fascinated by how technology transforms organizational decision-making
* Currently investigating DAOs and traditional craft organizations to understand decentralized coordination

Some things I believe:
* Organizations are entering an algorithmic era
    * AI systems are becoming active participants in decision-making
    * The future belongs to organizations that can blend human and machine intelligence
    * Traditional hierarchies are being challenged by new coordination mechanisms
* Research should bridge theory and practice
    * The best insights come from studying extreme cases
    * We need both rich qualitative understanding and computational pattern recognition
    * Theory must be grounded in real organizational experiences
* The human element remains crucial
    * Technology should augment rather than replace human agency
    * Social mechanisms are as important as technological ones
    * Understanding craft and tradition helps us design better digital futures

Current Research:
* Investigating how organizations evolve with algorithms
    * Studying DAOs as laboratories for new organizational forms
    * Examining traditional craft communities as contrast cases
    * Developing theory about decentralized coordination
* Using innovative methods
    * Combining ethnographic insights with AI-based analysis
    * Building new tools with BERTopic and LLMs
    * Creating bridges between qualitative and computational approaches
