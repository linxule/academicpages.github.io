I am a PhD student in the Department of Management and Entrepreneurship at the Imperial College Business School. I joined Imperial in 2019. Previously, I spent eight years studying and working in South Bend and Chicago.

## Academic Writing in Markdown
:pencil: Markdown helps me focus on the writing rather than organizing and formatting. See how to set up your workflow for [academic writing in Markdown](https://linxule.com/portfolio/portfolio-2/).

Software/tools that I am currently using:
* [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) (Zettelkasten, best integration with Zotero: in-app look up citation, one click to open associated PDF)
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (Zettelkasten, similar to Roam Research but offline. Local network graphs!)
* [Roam-Highligher - Chrome Extension](https://github.com/GitMurf/roam-highlighter#how-to-use-the-highlighter) (great to taking notes on webpages and paste highlights in markdown)
* [HackMD](hackmd.io) (Zettelkasten, GitHub integration, online collboration, publish, comments)


## Research resources and tools
A growing database of research softwares(DEVONthink, Notion, Stata), research methods([rtweet](https://rtweet.info/), workshops, and online courses (CARMA).
