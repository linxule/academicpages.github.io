I am a [PhD student](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/xule.lin) in the [Department of Management & Entrepreneurship at the Imperial College Business School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/academic-areas/management-entrepreneurship/). I joined Imperial in 2019. Piror to this, I studied at at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Chicago. I also gained valuable professional experience working at Ernst & Young (EY) in Chicago.

# Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of new forms of organizing and decentralized governance. Empirically, my work focuses on how social and algorithmic mechanisms enable decentralized communities (e.g., Decentralized Autonomous Organizations or DAOs) to develop and adapt their governance. Methodologically, my work combines a grounded theory approach with AI-based analysis tools (e.g., BERTopic). Overall, my research aims to advance theory on the dynamics enabling organizational design in the digital age.

Writing in markdown helps me focus on the writing rather than organizing and formatting. Check out my post on "Streamlining Academic Writing and Citation Management: The Case for a Markdown-centric Approach to Academic Writing [(MaCAW)](https://linxule.com/posts/2023/10/macaw/)"

I have also created and adapted a [collection of themes, scripts, templates](https://github.com/linxule/themes) for Zotero, Marked 2, Deckset, and more.
