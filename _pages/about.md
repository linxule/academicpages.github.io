# Academic Writing in Markdown
-----
Markdown helps me focus on the writing rather than organizing and formatting. See how to set up your workflow for [academic writing in Markdown](https://linxule.com/portfolio/portfolio-2/). 

# Resources and tools
-----
I have slowly built up a database of various learning resources and tools, including research softwares(DEVONthink, Notion, Stata), research methods(qualitative), workshops, and online courses (CARMA).
