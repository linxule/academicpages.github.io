Academic Writing in Markdown
-----
I created a project to document [how I write in Markdown for academic purposes](https://linxule.com/portfolio/portfolio-2/). Writing in Markdown helps me focus on the writing rather than organizing and formatting. Take a look at how I set up my workflows (w/ Pandoc, CSS,and Zotero).

Resources and tools
-----
During my study and research, I collect various types of learning resources and tools. I cover various topics, such as: research tools(DEVONthink, Notion, Stata), research methods(qualitative), workshops, and online courses (CARMA).
