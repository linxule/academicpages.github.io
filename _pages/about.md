# I investigate how human and machine intelligences are reshaping the future of organizing.

Some things about me:
* [PhD student](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/xule.lin) in the [Department of Management & Entrepreneurship at Imperial College Business School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/academic-areas/management-entrepreneurship/)
* Educational foundation built at University of Notre Dame and University of Chicago
* Professional experience at Ernst & Young (EY) in Chicago
* Currently studying how organizations evolve when algorithms become active participants in decision-making

Some things I believe:
* The future of organizing is hybrid
    * Algorithms are becoming active participants in organizational decision-making
    * Understanding decentralized coordination is crucial
    * Social and algorithmic mechanisms co-evolve
* Research needs methodological innovation
    * Rich ethnographic understanding combined with computational analysis
    * Extreme cases reveal fundamental organizing principles
    * Theory must emerge from empirical observation
* Technology should enhance human agency
    * The integration of technology changes coordination processes
    * Social mechanisms remain fundamental
    * Traditional craft knowledge informs digital futures

Current Research:
* Investigating new forms of organizing through DAOs
    * How communities develop and evolve without hierarchical structures
    * The interplay between social and algorithmic mechanisms
    * Technology's role in organizational design
* Studying traditional bespoke tailoring as a contrast
    * Decentralized coordination with minimal technology
    * Preservation of craft expertise
    * Adaptation in the digital age
* Methodological Innovation
    * Combining grounded theory with AI-based analysis
    * Using BERTopic and large language models (LLMs)
    * Bridging rich context and pattern recognition
