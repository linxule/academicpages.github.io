## Research Interests 

  * I am interested in the governance of DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations). Broadly, my research examines the governance structures/patterns/design of DAOs and associated ecosystem/meta-organization level output.

## (Academic) Writing in markdown 

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-markdown.svg)](http://commonmark.org)
