I am a PhD student in the Department of Management and Entrepreneurship at the Imperial College Business School. I joined Imperial in 2019. Previously, I spent eight years studying and working in South Bend and Chicago.

## Current research focus

  * Communities, collective action, social movements

## Academic Writing in Markdown
:pencil: Markdown (MD) helps me focus on the writing rather than organizing and formatting. See how to set up your workflow for [academic writing in Markdown](https://linxule.com/portfolio/portfolio-2/).

### Editors
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (Zettelkasten, similar to Roam Research but offline. Local network graphs!)
* [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) (Zettelkasten, best integration with Zotero: in-app look up citation, one click to open associated PDF)
* [HackMD](hackmd.io) (Zettelkasten, GitHub integration, online collboration, publish, comments)

### Add-ons and Extensions
* [Roam-Highligher - Chrome Extension](https://github.com/GitMurf/roam-highlighter#how-to-use-the-highlighter)
    * great for taking notes on webpages and copy highlights in MD
    * output formatted for Roam or Obsidian
* [Zotero to Roam Export](https://github.com/melat0nin/zotero-roam-export)("Zotero exports single or multiple items, as well as collections to Roam's JSON format")
* [My adaption of the original code](Zotero/Roam-QuickCopy2MD.js) to allow me to "QuickCopy" single items to MD format
    * Limited choices (e.g., no "colelctions as topics") of output due to Zotero's restrictions ([explained by melat0nin](https://github.com/melat0nin/zotero-roam-export/issues/17#issuecomment-660646353))
    * Sample output in MD
    ```
    # Digital affordances, spatial affordances, and the genesis of entrepreneurial ecosystems
